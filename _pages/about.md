Wenhua Cheng is a Software Engineer at Intel, with a strong background in large language model (LLM) quantization, model compression, and computer vision. Previously, he worked at Alibaba Cloud as a software engineer and at Intel Labs as a researcher. Wenhua holds a Master’s degree from Zhejiang University and a Bachelor’s degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

Wenhua's expertise spans two main domains:

1. **LLM Compression**: As the first author, he has contributed to methods such as **SignRound** and **SignRoundV2**, signed gradient descent-based rounding optimizations for LLM quantization, and **TEQ (Trainable Equivalent Transformation)**.

2. **Computer Vision**:  As a co-first author, he won **two championships** in the DawnBench competition, outperforming teams from Huawei, Google, and others. As the first author, he also ranked **4th and 6th** in two tracks of the **2017 ICDAR Scene Text Detection Competition**.

Wenhua has filed **21 patents**, 11 of which have been granted. Over the past four years, he has contributed to **300+ merged PRs**.
**He enjoys remote work. If you have such an opportunity, feel free to drop an email.**
